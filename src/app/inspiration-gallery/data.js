They show up at exactly the right moment  when a user taps on an unfamiliar tab or lands on a key feature for the first time  so the learning feels natural, not forced. Because tooltips are visually lightweight and easy to dismiss, they don’t interrupt flow or cause friction. They reduce cognitive load by offering one piece of helpful information at a time, helping users build comfort gradually. And since learners come to Unacademy with different goals  from cracking exams to picking up new skills  these dynamic tooltips personalize guidance based on behavior, not assumptions. The result is an onboarding experience that feels approachable, intuitive, and self-paced  setting users up for success from their very first tap.",

Tooltips appear as minimal, focused pop-ups  often with a single sentence and a clear CTA like “Try now” or “Swipe to continue.” This progressive, in-context approach gives users just the right amount of direction at each step, allowing them to explore with confidence.",

        "why_this_works_content": "The feedback prompt leverages familiar UX patterns  star ratings, quick-select tags, and optional comments  to make the process feel intuitive and non-intrusive. Because it appears while the user is still engaged and in context, it doesn’t interrupt or delay the next action.The flow is optimized for speed: just one tap is enough to share a meaningful signal. Behind the scenes, this data powers real-time interventions, such as flagging poor service, auto-sending apologies, or adding praise to a driver’s profile. By embedding CSAT within the natural rhythm of the ride experience, Uber turns a simple tap into a feedback loop that drives platform trust, safety, and satisfaction  all without asking users to do anything extra",

        "main_content": "Uber, the global ride-hailing giant, has seamlessly woven real-time CSAT prompts into the post-ride experience to continuously monitor quality and user sentiment. The moment a ride concludes, users are instantly prompted to rate their driver on a 1–5 star scale with optional tags like “Clean Car” or “Safe Driving”  and a text box to leave detailed feedback if desired. It’s quick, familiar, and requires almost no thought, making it effortless for riders to share their experience while it’s still fresh.Instead of relying on follow-up emails or infrequent surveys, Uber keeps feedback capture tightly integrated within the ride flow itself. The prompt appears just as the ride ends, when riders are still in the app confirming the fare or booking their next trip. This timing ensures high response rates, accurate insights, and actionable signals for Uber’s platform to continuously improve service quality, reward top drivers, and address issues in real time.",
